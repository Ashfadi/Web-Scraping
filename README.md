# National Parks Data Extraction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting and organizing data about U.S. National Parks from the [National Park Service website](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm). The data includes park names, categories, descriptions, addresses, phone numbers, and social media links, gathered programmatically using Python and web scraping techniques.

## Objectives
1. Extract links to all U.S. states from the National Park Service website.
2. Collect information about each park in every state, including:
   - Park Name
   - Category (e.g., National Monument, National Park, etc.)
   - Description
   - Address (split into multiple lines)
   - City, State, and Zip Code
   - Phone Number
   - Social Media Links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr)
3. Store the extracted data in a CSV file with a standardized schema.
